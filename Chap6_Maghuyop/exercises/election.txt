Election Day

It’s almost election day and the election officials need a program
to help tally election results. There are two candidates for office—Ironman
and Superman. The program’s job is to take as input the number of votes each
candidate received in each voting precinct and find the total number of votes
for each. The program should print out the final tally for each candidate—both
the total number of votes each received and the percent of votes each received.
Clearly a loop is needed. Each iteration of the loop is responsible for reading
in the votes from a single precinct and updating the tallies.
A skeleton of the program is in the file Election.java. Open a copy of the program
in your text editor and do the following.

Add the code to control the loop. You may use either a while loop or a do...while loop.
The loop must be controlled by asking the user whether or not there are more
precincts to report (that is, more precincts whose votes need to be added in).
The user should answer with the character y or n though your program should also
allow uppercase responses. The variable response (type String) has already been
declared. Add the code to read in the votes for each candidate and find the
total votes. Note that variables have already been declared for you to use.
Print out the totals and the percentages after the loop. Test your program to make
sure it is correctly tallying the votes and finding the percentages AND that the
loop control is correct (it goes when it should and stops when it should).
The election officials want more information. They want to know how many precincts
each candidate carried (won). Add code to compute and print this.
You need three new variables: one to count the number of precincts
won by Ironman, one to count the number won by Superman,
and one to count the number of ties. Test your program after adding this code.
