More Guessing

File Guess.java contains the skeleton for a program that uses
a while loop to play a guessing game.
(This problem is described in the previous lab exercise.)
Revise this program so that it uses a do ... while loop
rather than a while loop. The general outline using a do... while loop
is as follows:

// set up (initializations of the counting variables)
....

do {
	// read in a guess
	...
	// check the guess and print appropriate messages
	...
} while ( condition );

A key difference between a while and a do... while loop to
note when making your changes is that the body of the
do ... while loop is executed before the condition is ever tested.
In the while loop version of the program,
it was necessary to read in the user’s
first guess before the loop so there would be a value
for comparison in the condition.
In the do... while this “priming” read is no longer needed.
The user’s guess can be read in at the beginning of the body of the loop.
